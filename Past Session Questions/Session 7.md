#### For this case study, which of the following would you say would be the most appropriate software development implementation approach?

 a. ~~Custom~~ 
 b. ~~COTS~~
 c. ~~SaaS~~ 
 d. Hybrid of two or more of the above. 

#### Provide a clear rationale for your choice.
- It would be impossible for this kind of large complex system to be solely placed under one developmental approach especially when there are ***multiple teams working on the project***. They would each have their own software that can be adapted from a certain point (COTS) whilst others would be more likely to provided constant maintenance due to the constant influx of data and/or changes in requirements (SaaS). **But, the underlying base software would be bespoke (Custom)**
- Tesla would already have an implemented software within their vehicles but it would be adapted to work for what the government wants and to be interoperable with the rest of the software from ORACLE and others (see [[Tesla Models]] for more information) which means that their approach would be COTS
- ORACLE would provide their software as **SaaS** mainly due to the fact that the cities government has stated that they would simply store all of the information and that the information would be coming at an alarmingly quick rate. Their software is *very* interoperable as is and thus they would just provide maintenance and other features as a service
- PilotSoft LTD is the only company making **custom** software. They would be the one's in charge of making the base Ven drive application and the system to ensure that the transponders within the vehicles and the readers within the traffic lights can and will function at a good enough rate
#### Would any of the case study systems be appropriate for open-source approach? Why/Why not?
- NO. The system deals with *a lot* of sensitive information from people's unique identifiers ([[Offences]]) to traffic light control. Making the system open source would mean it would be easier for people to find ways to make the system vulnerable. In addition to this, the stakeholders would not want the software they are investing a lot into to be free for other's. Finally, the third party companies that are involved would be against it as it may divulge company assets such as how the internals of their custom software works which is not what they would.
