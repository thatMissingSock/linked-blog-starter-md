## Aim
- The aim of the 'Ven drive system' is to reduce the number of road related deaths and injuries in Venerabia by around 70-80%

## Method
- The government will enforce this by ensuring that ***all new vehicles*** in Venerabia will contain a 'Ven drive adaptor' by 2030 (including the [[Tesla Models]])
	- the adaptor is a software interface that allows wireless connection to the Tesla's onboard computer from an Android/IOS which should be running the [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] 
- The 'Ven drive system' will monitor the driver's actions and apply a set of *predetermined* penalties based on factors such as the severity of their actions and their history of actions
- The combination of the [[Ven Drive System]] and [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] will allow data to be sent from the vehicles to the [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] 
	- this data will allow for ***remote access***
- Readings from the machine are taken every 0.2 seconds (when the vehicle is in motion) and are sent to the [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] along with the vehicles unique identifier and GPS location
	
### Prevention rather than punishment
- The system uses a pre-emptive warning system to help reduce road-related injuries:
	- it issues an audio warning to fasten seat belts, observe speed limits, parking restrictions and to drive safely
		- if these are ignored then they have committed an [offence](Offences.md) and the correct penalty will be applied
- It will also issue visual and/or audio notification if the driver is approaching the speed limit depending on what [[Zones]] they are in



### As stated by the designer of the system:
> "The Ven Drive system is a driving observation and control system that will facilitate the detection of motoring offences, and apply a series of predetermined penalties. The system designers predict that Ven Drive will reduce the number of road-related deaths and injuries in Venerabia by around 70% to 80%."
