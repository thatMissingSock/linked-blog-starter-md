There are a multitude of rules and regulations to help the cities of Meruba and Aruba help reach that goal to reduce road-related accidents by 70-80%. 
This file shows most of them and the accompanying punishments.

# Penalties
- Penalties are issues by [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] operators without the need for local authority
- [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] operators receive a bonus for each offence they process
- Penalties are based on the ***severity*** of the offence and the ***history*** of the driver
- Penalties are transmitted via the [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] and by optional email
- Financial penalties have proven ineffective in a state like Venerabia and thus the following penalties have been implemented:
	- A driving ban of between one day and a lifetime
	- Temporary speed limitations on a vehicle
	- Temporary location restrictions on a vehicle
- Penalties ***are not time-restricted*** meaning they stay forever on a driver's record
- Failure to comply or *any* attempt to cheat the system results in a ***lifetime ban with NO appeal***

## Penalty Table

### Location Restrictions
- These are applied if they break the parking or [[Zones]] rules
- A notification is sent to the user (via optional email and [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]]) that they are banned from entering a certain zone
	- failure to comply will result in a 1-day **ban** 


# Appeals
- Appeals are allowed (unless otherwise stated) within 24 hours of receiving the notification
- Appeals are processed by a [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] operator within 24 hours
- Appeal decisions are communicated via [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] and optional email
- *Frivolous* appeals result in doubling the severity of the original penalty
- Appeals are unlikely to be caused by system errors as:
> 	"Ven Drive operators have been shown in testing to be 99.9836% reliable in determining correct penalties."
- Appeals are most likely to be for mitigating or special circumstances
	- The onus (burden of proof) is on the driver WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT
- If an appeal is successful then the penalty is instantly removed
# Bans
- These are enforced by sending a lock notification to a user's [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] which locks the ignition of their [[Tesla Models]]
	- for safety, they do not come into affect straight away
	- once notified, the user must return the vehicle to their home location **within 4 hours**
	- once the vehicle is detected at home by [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] and idle, [[Ven Drive System]] will lock the vehicle until the ban is lifted
	- if the user does not return the vehicle within the time frame:
		- it will be locked the next time the vehicle is parked
- **IF A LIFETIME BAN IS APPLIED:**
	- [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] is deleted from the user's phone and cannot be reinstalled on any device
# Speeding
- As a vehicle is driven, the [[Ven Drive Mobile Application]] will take readings from the vehicle every **0.2 seconds** whilst the vehicle is in motion and send it to the [[Ven Drive Data Centre]]
- It sends data such as:
	- speed
	- GPS data
	- the vehicle's unique identifier
- Using the data, it can see if the vehicle is adhering to the [[Zones]] current rules

## Speeding Offences
- These penalties are specific for if a user speeds based on the [[Zones]] they are in
- If it is a user's first time:
	- the vehicle's maximum speed will be set to 20KPH for 10 days regardless of what [[Zones]] they are in
- If it is a user's second time:
	- the vehicle's maximum speed will be set to 20KPH(it says MPH) for 20 days regardless of what [[Zones]] they are in
- For any more offences:
	- the user will get a **ban**
	
# Seatbelts
- Along with the pre-emptive warnings, seatbelt data is sent every second to the [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] 
	- if a seatbelt is not fastened when sent then an [offence](Offences.md) has been committed and the correct accompanying penalty will be applied
		- the driver does get a notification that they have committed an offence too
- It is the ***driver's responsibility that all seatbelts are on during the journey***

# No Entry and No Stopping Zones
- Using the GPS data, the system can detect if the vehicle has: 
	- strayed into the no-driving [[Zones]] 
	- stopped in the no stopping [[Zones]]
	- driven in emergency lanes
- Note that these offences are given ***without exemption***

# Traffic Lights
- **ALL** traffic lights in the new cities are *wirelessly* connected to the [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] to allow for data transmission to and from
- **ALL** traffic lights in the new cities now contain transponder readers to accompany the new [[Tesla Models]] radio transponders
	- at the moment of crossing, the vehicle will send its unique identifier to the traffic light which will determine if the light was the right colour at the time of crossing and the following will occur:
		- if the light is determined to be red, then a [[Ven Drive Data Centre]] operator will apply the appropriate penalty and communicate this to the driver

# Parking
- **ALL** parking in the new cities are controlled
- The parking is based on the [[Zones]]
	1. parking is reserved for emergency vehicles and disabled drivers
	2. on-street parking is reserved for residents but they must obtain a permit from [[Ven Drive Data Centre]]
	3. on-street parking is allowed for both residents and non-residents 
- Drivers are given a grace period of 1 minute in restricted zones for dropping off purposes, if a vehicle is determined to have been stationary for longer than minute than an offence has been committed
