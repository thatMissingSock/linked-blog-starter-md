This interview was with the ***HEAD OF VEN DRIVE OPERATIONS***:
>	Interviewer: Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: It is my pleasure.
>	
>	Interviewer: Can you please explain to us how the Ven Drive System works?
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: It’s complex, but I will try my best. All drivers in Venerabia will have a brand-new Tesla vehicle by 2028. The government is generously covering 90% of the initial purchase cost, and 50% of the ongoing recharging costs.
>	
>	Interviewer: How do these vehicles differ from normal Teslas?
>	
>	The Venerabia Tesla vehicles will have a special connection to the onboard compute that will allow our mobile App to pair with a vehicle’s computer wirelessly. The Ven Drive App will have access to performance and driving data. So, for example, it will be able to get the speed at which the vehicle is being driven, whether seatbelts have been engaged, how long a vehicle has been idle, etc. It will also be able to reveal performance data, such as the current charge level, driving efficiency and other useful data we can use for optimizing driving in the country.
>	
>	Interviewer: So how does the data from the vehicle get to the VDDC?
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: Data from the vehicle is relayed via the phone network to VDDC. For example, speed data is sent every 0.2 seconds. And seat belt data is sent every second. Non-safety related data, like battery charge level, is sent less frequently. GPS data is also sent at 0.2-second intervals from the driver’s phone along with the other vehicle data. This enables VDDC to see if a vehicle is being driven too vast for a particular zone.
>	
>	Interviewer: So what does VDDC do with the data?
>	 
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: Well, we store it all. We have some serious Oracle data servers and databases in Mumbai for that purpose. Otherwise, we don’t do much with it. Unless a driving offence is detected. In that case, the system identifies and records the offence being committed and notifies one of our operators. The operator can then access a driver’s driving record on the Ven Drive Management Application. Once the operator has the relevant information and can see if a driver has committed previous offences, he or she can determine the correct penalty to be issued. The driver will then be notified of the penalty via the Ven Drive App and optional email. Itwill also display the penalty notification on the Tesla’s dashboard computer. Also, the penalty notification, either a lock, a location restriction, or a speed restriction will be applied remotely. And, we are also going to use the latest data analysis software to produce some system performamance reports. These should let us know how effectively the system is working and where it needs to be tweaked. For example, where are offences taking place, at what time, etc. 
>	
>	Interviewer: Is it true that all offences will result in a penalty? There will be no warnings like before?
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: The previous system was overly liberal. Driver’s got warnings or fines. This made little difference. Which was why we had one of the highest road death and injury rates per capita in the entire world. Those days are over. The minimum penalties now will be restrictions on speed and location. But for some offences (like jumping red lights), and for persistent offenders, serious bans will be given. This will not be done by the courts anymore, which was a waste of resources and time because specialist lawyers slowed the system down. It will be done by our trained operators at VDDC outside of the legal system. 
>	
>	Interviewer: But won’t people just ignore the penalties? 
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: That will not be possible. When I say a penalty is automatically imposed, it means that Ven Drive will physically restrict the use of the vehicle. If there is a speed restriction, then the vehicle speed will be physically limited. It won’t matter if you try to drive your vehicle faster, it will simply not go faster. And it won’t matter if you try to start your vehicle if you have a ban, it simply will not start. Plain and simple, Ven Drive can be used to control what a vehicle can do, whether it can be driven or not, where it can be driven, and how it can be driven. 
>	
>	Interviewer: Won’t people try and cheat the system?
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: That is easier said than done, my friend. The Teslas will not start without being connected to Ven Drive. They will not move without being connected to Ven Drive. Nothing a driver does will be invisible to Ven Drive. We will even be able to see how a vehicle is being driven by remotely controlling the onboard cameras. Further, a phone number can only be registered to one person. And, Ven Drive must be activated by facial recognition, so a person cannot use another person’s phone. They may find a way to cheat in time, but we will be merciless with those found cheating the system. There will be an automatic lifetime ban with no right of appeal. For those systematically trying to defraud the system, there will be prison sentences of up to 10 years. 
>	
>	Interviewer: What do you say to those who have criticized the system as authoritarian? 
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: I say to them, go and talk to the mothers of the children who have died on our roads. Go and talk to the husbands who have lost wives. The status quo was intolerable. Change was necessary. Nobody should be afraid if they drive within the law. 
>	
>	Interviewer: How about development? How is that going?
>	
>	Head of Ven Drive Operations: Well it continues apace. We have the proof of concept and the designs. These were created by Tesla Engineers in Austin and our in-house team here in Venerabia. The next phase is implementation. We have contracted Global Systems Solutions from Vancouver to provide and install the hardware both here and in Mumbai. The software is being developed by PilotSoft Ltd here in Venerabia. Of course, they will be working in conjunction with Tesla. It’s all very complex, but we have a great team of project managers. And fingers crossed it all goes to plan.
